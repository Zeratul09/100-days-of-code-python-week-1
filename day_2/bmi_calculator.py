#EXTRA NOTES NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION

#Note: Using the // (Floor Division) you can turn the result into an integer right away.
#No need to convert it manually.

#You can use the "shorthand" /= or += to quickly do a mathematical operation without specifying variables.

#Let's say you want to add something to the result that "your BMI is:"
#For this you can use f strings so something like:
print(f"Your BMI is {BMI_int}, because your height is {height} ms and your weight is {weight} kgs")
#As you can see you simply add f (not F) at the beginning of the string 
# then you can freely add any varibles to the string regardless of their respective datatype.
